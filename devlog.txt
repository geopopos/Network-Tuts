[x] update server to handle multiple player lobbies (once game starts new joinable lobby is created)
[x] update not network master players to be a different color with self_modulate

[] move collission processing to server

updated multiple-lobby functionality.
Previous set up was not creating separate worlds to manage player state, so it got wonky.
I set up the code to set up separate worlds for now own
I set up an rpc call so that the world name in the server is the same as the one in the client
